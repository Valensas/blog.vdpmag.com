**VDP MANAGER**

*Widget Template:* Turn any widget into a template and update multiple pages at once. To use this feature all you need to do is drag any widget under "Pages" in the Inspector Panel and drag it onto the "Template Widget List" right below.

*VDPx File Extension:* Weâ€™ve made major improvements to the VDP file structure and decreased file size more than %60 allowing to work, transfer and upload magazines much faster.

*Server Restore:* No more losing VDP files or back issues. If you need a copy of your VDP file just restore from our servers and download the latest copy. Please note that in order to be able to restore an issue you will need to have a successfully uploaded copy resting on our servers.

*Version Control:* Some of you like to work in teams or work from home. In this case, you may experience trouble working on the latest version of a VDP file, and in order to prevent any data loss we developed version control. Each time you login to our servers VDP will check to see if there is a more up-to-date version, thus eliminating conflict among multiple VDP files.

*Table of Contents:* Creating a Table of Contents is much easier now. Add all articles at once under the Inspector Panel, ToC.

*Get VDP Manager v2.7 by clicking the download button below. Minimum System Requirements: OS X 10.9+*
