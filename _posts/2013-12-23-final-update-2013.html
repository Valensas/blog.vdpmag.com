title: Final Update of the Year
---
<p>Our final update of the year comes with several fixes and improvements for <strong>VDP Manager</strong>. The new Manager offers two additional viewing options, Outline being the default, Spread View and Collection View, both for better viewing and organizing your content.</p>
<p>We had an issue where pages with HTML content wouldn’t appear on thumbnails, so we thought ¨let’s not have that problem again¨. Finally we made some stability improvements and squished some bugs that caused loss of content in some instances.</p>
<p>So go ahead and download the new Manager and have a great new year.</p>
