title: VDP Portal enables sending Push Notifications
---
<p>VDP users can now send push notifications right within our Portal. When you log in to&nbsp;<a href="http://mngmnt.valensas.com.tr" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://mngmnt.valensas.com.tr']);" target="_blank">VDP Portal</a>&nbsp;you will see a new section named Push Notification on the left-side menu. In order to send a push notification, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Add your certificate:</strong>&nbsp;If you have added a push certificate before, skip this step. Otherwise,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>select Certificate link from the menu and then press Add button. On that Upload Certificate form, provide your push notification production certificate as .p12 file and the password for it.
<pre>Note: If you don't know how to obtain the p12 file, please refer to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ProvisioningDevelopment/ProvisioningDevelopment.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH104-SW1" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://developer.apple.com']);" target="_blank">Local and Push Notification Programming Guide</a> published by Apple. You need to achieve steps 1-7 on "Creating the SSL Certificate and Keys" and 1-3 on "Installing the SSL Certificate and Key on the Server".</pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Make sure you have a valid certificate:&nbsp;</strong>On the certificates page, you will see the current push certificate. Make sure that it’s not expired. If it’s expired, go back to step 1 and replace the certificate with a newer one.</li>
<li><strong>List messages:&nbsp;</strong>Select Messages link on the menu. There you will see the list of previous messages with their title and send date.</li>
<li><strong>Send message: </strong>Press<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Send button. On the following form, provide a message name which is just for your future reference and won’t be seen by your users. Next, you need to enter at least one of three fiealds – text message, badge number and alert sound. Press Send and voila!</li>
</ol>
