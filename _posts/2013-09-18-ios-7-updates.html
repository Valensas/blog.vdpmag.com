<p>Since Apple announced the launch of its much spoken iOS 7 Update for today weâ€™ve been working hard to maintain our systems and developed a series of fixes for the new operating system standard. </p>
<p>We are happy to announce that all VDP applications are now ready for iOS7 and have been submitted to Apple for approval. Your app should be available for update very soon. So sit tight and watch for releasing your app as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p>Please contact Support in VDP Portal if you come across any problems with the new update. </p>
